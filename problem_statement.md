# GRAPH FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY
### Help historians understand complex interpersonal historical relationships using graph database.
 

#X: Empower professional historians as well as general public with a novel approach to the study of genealogy and ancestral relations
Author: Jana M., Jakub K.

## The Problem

In the field of history, family trees are a classical tool to display relationships between people and 
outline historical context. Though traditionally focused on royal or aristocratic family lines, in recent years genealogy 
has taken a more democratic turn as an increasing number of people from all backgrounds have been showing interest in
exploring their own family roots and heritage. There are many crowd-sourced family trees, data sets and research tools which 
have become available.

The problem with this kind of data is that it is saved in a traditional table format. There are limits posed
by traditional databases when working with the data - complexity becomes a problem already with a couple of generations,
and it is practically impossible to achieve any deeper multi-generational insight or analysis.

## The Challenge

We want to empower historians as well as people with personal interest in genealogy to gain deeper, more accurate insights
from ancestral data in an easy and quick way.

Our goal is to create a solution that allows anyone to parse and upload ancestral data in GEDCOM format into 
the TigerGraph database and provide them with tools and queries allowing for a complex research of multi-generational 
ancestral relations while reaching a more accurate understanding than would ever be possible by means of a 
traditional database. We believe graph databases have a potential to be a game-changer for genealogy enabling researchers
to attain a more precise understanding of the past. 

## Resources

There is a limited amount of resources about advanced analysis of genealogical data with novel graph database approach.
The most interesting datasets could be found in public datasets of royal family trees:
1) UK royal family dataset (Not limited to only UK royals): 
2) Extensive royal families database. (Available after registration): https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117045/version/V2/view
